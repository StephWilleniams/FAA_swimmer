# Fore-aft Asymmetric Swimmer code.
## Stephen Williams

# Notes

This code numerically solves for the motion of a microswimmer.
This is done according to a 2nd order Stochastic Runge-Kutta numerical scheme.

# Tasks
- Add straight boundaries.
- Include torques into the shaped swimmer motion.
- This about how to add in interestingly shaped boundaries.
